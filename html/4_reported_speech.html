    <h1 align="center">Reported Speech</h1>
  
    <p>Reported Speech is used when we tell someone what another person said. To do this we can use Direct or Indirect Speech.<br><br>
    Direct speech is used to repeat what someone else has said, and indirect speech is used to report on what someone else has said.<br>
    <br>Pronouns also usually changes in indirect speech</p>
    <p>   "I enjoy working in my garden", said Bob --> Bob said that he enjoyed working in his garden.<br>
          "We played tennis for our school", said Alina --> Alina told me they'd played tennis for thei school.</p>
    <br>However, if you are the person or one of the people who spoke, the pronouns don't change</p>
    <p>   "I'm working on my thesis", I said --> I told her that I was working on my thesis.<br>
          "We wanted our jobs back", we said --> We said that we wanted our jobs back.</p>
    <br>We also change demonstratives and adverbs of time and place if they are no longer accurate.</p>
    <p>   "This is my house" --> He said this was his house. (You are currently in front of the house.)<br>
          "This is my house" --> He said that was his house. (You aren't currently in front of the house)</p>
    <br>In the same way these changes to THOSE, now changes to THEN, yesterday changes to THE DAY BEFORE,<br>
    <p> tomorrow changes to THE NEXT/THE FOLLOWING DAY and ago changes to BEFORE.<br></p>
