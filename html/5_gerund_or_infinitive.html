    <h1 align="center">Gerund or Infinitive</h1><br>
  
    <p>The GERUND is often used for an action that happens before or at the same time as the action of the main verb<br>
    The formula is "verb + gerund". Examples:<br>
    <br>1. I enjoy playing --- 2. I denied stealing</p>
    <p><br>The INFINITIVE is often used for actions that follow the action of the main verb.<br>
    The formula is "verb + infinitive". Examples:<br>
    <br>1. I decided to visit my uncle --- 2. I want to go out</p>
    <br>A verb can be followed by another verb. The second usually needs to change into the "-ing" form or the "to + infinitive"<br>
    form. Wich form you needs depend on what the first verb is. There's many rules: </p><br>
    <p>I - Verbs followed by the -ING form<br>
          When enjoy, admit and mind are followed by another verb, it must be in -ing.</p>
    *I enjoy travelling --- *He admited stealing the necklace --- *I don't mind waiting if you're busy</p><br>
    <p>II - After verbs that express likes/dislikes<br>
          Like, love, enjoy, dislike, hate<br>
          *I like playing soccer but I hate boxing.<br>
          NOTE: "like, love, hate,..." can also be followed by an infinitive<br>
          *I like to watch TV in the evening.</p>
    <p>III - After verbs such as: <br>
            admit --> He admitted stealing the wallet<br>
            advise --> I wouldn't advise buying a used car<br>
            allow --> They don't allow smoking here -- NOTE: When an object is introduced an infinitive is used instead of gerund.<br>
            anticipate --> He anticipated passing the exam<br>
            avoid --> She avoided meeting him<br>
            appreciate --> I appreciate working with you<br>
            complete --> They completed building their house<br>
            consider --> She considered starting a new business<br>
            delay --> She delayed doing her homework<br>
            deny --> He deneied stealing the money<br>
            fancy --> Fancy meeting you here!<br>
            finish --> She finished writting the letter<br>
            go --> Go swimming<br>
            imagine --> He imagines meeting her<br>
            involve --> The job involves working in teams<br>
            keep --> He keeps complaining about his grilfriend<br>
            mention --> He mentioned working in that company<br>
            mind --> He mentioned working in that company<br>
            miss --> He misses talking to her<br>
            permit --> They don't permit smoking here. -- SAME NOTE AS "ALLOW"<br>
            postpone --> they postponed traveling to Japan<br>
            practice --> She practiced painting<br>
            reject --> He rejected working with them<br>
            risk --> She risks losing her job<br>
            suggest --> I suggest leaving early<br>
            resist --> He couldn't resist eating the cake<br>
            waste time/money --> Don't waste my time complaining<br><br>
    <p>IV - After prepositions: keep on, interesed in, instead of, good at, before, after, etc.<br>
          *I'm interesed in collecting stamps --- *After playing football i drank orange juice</p><br>
    <p>V - After some expressions: It's no use..., It's not good..., There's no point in..., I can't help..., I don't mind..., I can't stand..., etc.<br>
          *It's no use convicing him to met her</p>
